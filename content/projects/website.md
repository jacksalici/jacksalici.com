As you probably have imagined, I built this website myself. Actually, I've built it several times because I can't decide how I want it.

Currently the architecture is based on Hugo framework, and the whole thing is hosted on Netlify.

Since the website is static, it's possible to pay nothing for the hosting. The only expense I'm in charge of is the domain, which I have bought from Cloudflare for a few dollars per year.

The entire source code is open source and avaible on [this Github repository](https://github.com/jacksalici/jacksalici.com).

I also have added some easter eggs that no one will ever notice so if you are curious look for a 404 error for one istance of my broken humor...
