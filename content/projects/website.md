As you probably have imagined, I built this website myself. Actually, I've built it several times because I can't decide how I want it.

Currently the architecture is based on __Hugo__ framework, and the whole thing is hosted on __Netlify__.

Since the website is static, it's possible to pay nothing for the hosting. The only expense I'm in charge of is the domain, which I have bought from __Cloudflare__ for a few dollars per year.

The entire source code is open source and avaible on [this Github repository](https://github.com/jacksalici/jacksalici.com).

I also have added some easter eggs that no one will ever notice so if you are curious look for a 404 error for one istance of my broken humor...

Having said that, do you know that I really love pizza, coding and succulent plants? This website is also reachable at <span class="special-link">[🍕💻🌵.tk](http://🍕💻🌵.tk)</span> (emojis order obviously matters).

Just looking at [these](/projects/emojipoll/) [projects](http://localhost:1313/projects/emoji-list-api/) you know that I also like emojis but normally they change according to the operative system where they are read. So, I've applied the __Tweemoji__ (opensource Twitter Emoji) library to be sure to get the same emoji experience all the devices.
