During the last month, one of my University mates and I have developed our first video game.  It's a simple 2d game for Android written in Java. The source code can be found on our [Github page](https://github.com/overloadedllama/leapingllama). The alpha version can be also downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overloadedllama.leapingllama).
