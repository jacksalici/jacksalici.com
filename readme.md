# Just my website. 🥸💅
![Scores](https://github.com/jacksalici/jacksalici.com/blob/main/public/uploads/scores.png)


Howdy! If you are reading this, you probably already know that the website simultaneously represents 📺:

- a portfolio for my personal and academic projects 🖼️,
- a kind of online resume 🪪,
- and a placeholder space for my nickname domain ⚓️.

_This code may not be the prettiest you have ever seen 👀, nor the most grammatically correct text. Please consider it a work in progress and not ready for production. Consider also that the main target of this `readme` is the future myself, so I don't pretend to be serious. 🎭_


## Architecture 🏗️

Currently, the website is powered by Astro.

**Posts are stored in `/content` folder.**

## Commands 🧞

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

Once the edits have been made, *just push the commits*: Netlify will build the website, update the `publish` folder and host it.

## Changelog 🕰️

I like to change its style often so I tagged the main last versions, starting from 2021. Sadly, previous versions have been lost (I was not an expert in git yet and I made some embarrassing mistakes).
