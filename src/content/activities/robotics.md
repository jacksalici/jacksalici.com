In the field of robotics, particularly in human-robot interaction (HRI), the ability to generate and manipulate robot poses is crucial. This involves creating sequences of joint angles that a robot must follow to perform specific actions. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promise in this area, enabling intuitive control and interaction with robots.
