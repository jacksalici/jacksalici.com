In modern industrial contexts, the ability to analyze time series data is crucial for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and operational efficiency. During my PhD I focus on developing deep learning models for time series analysis, particularly but not limited to context of industrial applications.

I am currently working on projects with several companies that may become public in the future.
