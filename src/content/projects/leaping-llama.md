During the last months, Giovanni and I developed our first video game, __Leaping Llama__.  It's a simple 2d game for Android written in Java, designed as the final project for the course of OOP. The source code can be found on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/overloadedllama/leapingllama). ~The alpha version can be also downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overloadedllama.leapingllama).~


> ðŸš¨ Unfortunately, since early 2024 the app have been removed from the Play Store. A major update would be necessary to update both the game engine (a bit outdated nowadays) and the policies that Google requires to all the app in its store. We are planning this maintenance for mid 2025, but delays could occour.

Thanks to everyone who has played even one to Leaping Llama!
