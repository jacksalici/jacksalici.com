[Notion](https://notion.so) is a nice tool for "task management, project management, knowledge management" (from Wikipedia), that allows you to use databases as lists of notes and pages. I have been using it for years but sometimes I found that adding the record was time-wasting, so I have been developing a __CLI__ (command-line interface) in Python for managing those databases. If you want to give it a try:  
```
pip install notion-cli-list-manager
```  

You can read more on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jacksalici/notion-cli-list-manager). Note that the project is not completed yet, so commands could change a bit.
