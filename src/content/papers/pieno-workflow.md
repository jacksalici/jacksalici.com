**Abstract:** The complete workflow of the RI-PIENO framework is presented, a system for refueling itinerary optimization that extends the original PIENO design. While prior work introduced the conceptual modules of RI-PIENO, their operational pipeline was not described in detail. This study makes the workflow explicit, covering the end-to-end process from CAN Bus data acquisition and stop detection to the construction of daily trip graphs, refueling optimization, and mileage prediction. By clarifying the sequence of operations, the contribution provides a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research and development.
