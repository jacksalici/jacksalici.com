As you probably have imagined, I built this website myself. Actually, I've built it several times because I can't decide how I want it.
Currently, the architecture is based on _Hugo_ framework. This lets the website be static, which is an advantage both for performance and lightweightness, and because it makes it possible to pay nothing for the hosting (the whole thing is hosted on _Netlify_). The only expense I'm in charge of is the domain, which I have bought from _Cloudflare_ for a few dollars per year.

The template is also been coded by me, using _Tailwind_ and _DaisyUI_ library and the page scores are amazings. It's called Salinger Theme and can be found [here](/projects/salinger-theme).

The entire source code is open source and available on [this](https://github.com/jacksalici/jacksalici.com) Github repository.

I also have added some easter eggs that no one will ever notice so if you are curious look for a 404 error for one instance of my broken humor...

Having said that, do you know that I love pizza, coding and succulent plants? This website is also reachable at "[üçïüíªüåµ.tk](http://üçïüíªüåµ.tk)" (emojis order matters).

Just looking at [these](/projects/emojipoll/) [projects](/projects/emoji-list-api/) you know that I also like emojis but normally they change according to the operative system where they are read. So, I've applied the _Tweemoji_ (open-source Twitter Emoji) library to be sure to get the same emoji experience on all the devices. The theme also uses some _Google Symbols_ and it suppors _Font Awesome_.
